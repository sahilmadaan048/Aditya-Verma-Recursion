flow: 

1. make input smaller but why ?

innput small ho jaat hai we dont do it deliberately

ham kuch kaam karte hain ehich is primtary , kuch decisions lete hain
unn decisions ki wajeh se input chhota ho jaata hai

ultimately ham decision lene ki koshish kar rahe hain

input apne aap chhote ho jayenge

*/


/*
1. Recursion => decision space

choice + decision

then recursion woll be used

*/

/*
3. Recursive tree => problem is done

example for subset problem

*/

/*

input output method

we will represent these choices usinf a recursive tree

np of branches  => no of choices

we can do it dfor   o/p    i/p
                    " "   "ab" 

                "" "b"  ,    "a" "b"
          
      "" "" ,  "b" ""       "a" "" , "ab" "" 


we get our ans when the inout string bwcomes empty ""

this is how the flowo will work

*/

/*
desgin a recursive tree

fuck the problem
write the code basically
